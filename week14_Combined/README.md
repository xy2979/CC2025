# Final Project: Mirror – Silent String

---
### Abstract of the concept
The inspiration for this project comes from playing cat’s cradle with my friends when I was a child. We didn’t talk when we played — we communicated through our hands and our shared rhythm. In this project, I use p5.js and ml5.js to turn the hand gestures of cat’s cradle, and each pattern becomes a sentence. These sentences will also appear at the bottom left corner of the screen. The concept is about childhood trust, silent communication, and using hand gesture as language.

### Cat's Cradle Patterns I designed
