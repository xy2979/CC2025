# Assignment 3 – Abstract Clock



#### Inspiration
The inspiration for this project came to me over lunch while eating pasta. I was fascinated by the speed of eating food. 

#### Quick Sketch
I quickly drafted the different design views and wrote down the functions I may use in this project. I want to use the **bite of food** to show the passage of time. The **expiration date** on the food package to show the current month and year. As I always end up rushing to eat things right before they hit the expiration date.
