## Why We’re Not Using AI in This Course, Despite Its Obvious Benefits by Patrick Lin

> In the age of AI, there is a paradox. With the accumulated knowledge of the world now at their fingertips, students need their teachers more, not less. Why? Because students need teachers to get them to do hard things now that are good for them later. Because AI can be a crutch if students use it mindlessly, carelessly, and without the objective to develop their own capabilities. And because teachers are role models for what genuine intellectual engagement looks like, both online and in real life. To paraphrase Aristotle, “the roots of education are often bitter, but the fruit is sweet.”

Why the quote stood out to me:
- I agree that students need teachers more—they need guidance from real human beings.
- AI is just a machine; it lacks a human body, emotions, and independent thought. From AI you can get procedures and answers, but not the deep, formative experience of wrestling with problems through difficult times.
- While AI may handle numerical problems very well, it cannot truly understand the human heart. The same goes for learning to program: if you simply ask AI for answers and skip the process of solving problems yourself, you may finish the course with a high grade, but in reality you will have learned nothing.

> Technology is not the enemy. Arguably, without technology, humans wouldn’t exist. As examples, think about the tools and materials needed to create clothes and shelter, as well as to cook food and meet other basic necessities. But technology and automation always come with tradeoffs, so it’s important to understand what we stand to gain (the benefits) and what we stand to lose (the risks) in order to make informed policy decisions as well as personal decisions, such as how and when to use AI in our lives. Otherwise, we are sleepwalking into the future and may awake to a world we don’t like.

Why the quote stood out to me:
- We should use AI technology appropriately, but we must not overuse it. 
- The existence of AI has made our lives more convenient, and some very difficult tasks no longer need to be done by humans. However, the current advanced level of AI will also cause some people to lose their jobs and result in a surplus of labor force. 
- I believe that AI should be applied in the appropriate fields, rather than being used indiscriminately.

> Research is also showing that AI is homogenizing our thoughts, i.e., our ideas are “regressing to the mean” or collapsing to the most popular or average takes, which means unoriginal ideas. This doesn’t necessarily mean that everyone is pushed to the same ideas, but AI “can funnel users with similar personalities and chat histories toward similar conclusions.” As with AI art, AI writing can look weirdly the same no matter which AI app created it.

Why the quote stood out to me:
- I've never thought of this idea before. I like what he said "Regressing to mean". 
- Isn’t this a way of making people believe they’ve found a like-minded crowd when they actually haven’t? Because those conclusions were summarized by AI for us, we mistakenly assume that’s what everyone originally thought.
- AI can lead to a situation where, during the process of learning programming, there were multiple solutions available, but due to the "Regression to the Mean", it eventually resulted in everyone coming up with only one solution. I think this is a very terrifying thing.

## Program or be Programmed by Douglas Rushkoff (Page 10)

> A society that looked at the Internet as a path toward highly articulated connections and new methods of creating meaning is instead finding itself disconnected, denied deep thinking, and drained of enduring values. 

Why the quote stood out to me:
- I think this is very interesting. 
- The Internet is a double-edged sword. It can bring people closer connections and more innovations, but at the same time, it can also create an information cocoon, causing people to lose their ability to make independent judgments. Because the Internet is constantly outputting various viewpoints in all kinds of ways, it is very easy to be led by the viewpoints on the Internet.
- This reminds me that some people, when learning programming languages, they simply copy and paste the formulas from programming tutorials. They are accustomed to constantly patching and modifying their own code, but they lack their own thoughts and understanding of the code.
