# Week 2: Color and Form


**A p5.js project that adds at least two more shapes to the p5.js code you created in class**

#### In this week's project, I added several shapes in the p5.js file:
1. A coral circle with a light purple outline
2. A navy blue ellipse with light blue outline
3. A pink quad with light blue outline and an offset blue outline with same shape

#### Functions I used:
1. Adjust stroke color and stroke weight

`stroke(111, 56, 250);`
`strokeWeight(4);`

2. Fill in color and no fill

`fill(30, 78, 200);`
`noFill();`

3. Embed expressions inside of functions

`quad(360 + 30, 580 + 30, 360 + 30, 400 + 30, 100 + 30, 300 + 30, 100 + 30, 580 + 30);`

4. Set X, Y variables for triangle

`triangle(originX, originY, originX + 60, originY, originX + 30, originY + 160);`

4. Comment

`//change stroke to light purple`
